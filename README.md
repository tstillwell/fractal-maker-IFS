# fractal-maker-IFS

Uses an iterated function system (IFS) to create
fractals from a set of IFS equations

Input one equation per line with a probability weight as the last parameter.

Each equation should be in the form "a b c d e f p" to be valid.

Total probability rate for all equations should not exceed one.
